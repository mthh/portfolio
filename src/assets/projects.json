    "description": "CoViKoa (which is an abbreviation for the french, albeit incorrect, sentence <em>Comment on Visualise Quoi</em>) is a framework for the geovisualisation of Semantic Web data. For this, it uses an ecosystem of 10 ontologies, 6 which are original proposals and 4 which are reused from the literature.\nIt allows a user (typically a knowledge engineer) to describe, in a purely declarative way and in RDF, a geovisualisation. This description is done in a specification document which is read by the framework and which allows, thanks to SHACL rules, to obtain a RDF graph containing the links between the data and their symbolisation within the components of a geovisualisation. Other elements such as the possibility of defining interactions and the possibility of transforming the data to be portrayed contribute to the creation of rich geovisualisations. The resulting RDF graph is published behind a SPARQL interface and we also provide a generic web client to create the corresponding geovisualisation using this graph. To test its relevance, we use it to visualise data from three different models.",

For its part, GASPAR allows the capturing of the initial search area, the capturing of clues, and the restitution of the victim's location area in a 2d view and in a 3d view.\nIt uses libraries such as OpenLayers, Itowns and Lumino.js.\nAn article describing the latest version of the application is under review at the moment.",

On client-side, Magrit is written in modern JavaScript (ES6) and uses notably the d3.js library.",

A central point of the proposed exploration is thus the choice of a reference territory (\"my territory\") by the user.\nIt allows the use of several representation and analysis functionalities to compare a territory with the other territories in the study area: positioning with regard to one indicator (bar chart), two indicators (scatter plot) and three or more indicators (radar chart), and similarity with regard to one or more indicators (two proposed representations).\nRegioviz is written entirely in JavaScript and works with any dataset prepared according to its specifications. In order to test the genericity of the tool and the data model, we prepared two other datasets (indicators of various French statistical subdivisions and electoral results of delegations in Tunisia).",

It is an appealing representation that allows, for example, the distortion of a reference space to represent travel times or estimated positions in spatial cognition.\nThe credit for this type of anamorphosis goes to Colette Cauvin (UMR Théma - Univ.
